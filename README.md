The Boston Housing Dataset Analysis project focuses on exploring and analyzing a widely used dataset related to housing prices in Boston
Additionally, I've employed  machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost to build models that can predict housing prices based on the available features. This will provide insights into the relative importance of different variables in determining housing prices.
